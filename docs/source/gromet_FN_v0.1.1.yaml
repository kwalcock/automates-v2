    This document defines the GroMEt Function Network data model.
    Note that Metadata is defined in separate spec.

    __Using Swagger to Generate Class Structure__

    To automatically generate Python or Java models corresponding to this
    document, you can use
    [swagger-codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).
    This can be used to generate the client code based off of this spec,
    and in the process this will generate the data model class structure.

    1. Install via the method described for your operating system
       [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#Prerequisites).
       Make sure to install a version after 3.0 that will support openapi 3.
    2. Run swagger-codegen with the options in the example below.
       The URL references where the yaml for this documentation is stored on
       github. Make sure to replace CURRENT_VERSION with the correct version.
       To generate Java classes rather, change the `-l python` to `-l java`.
       Change the value to the `-o` option to the desired output location.
       ```
       swagger-codegen generate -l python -o ./client -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml4ai/automates-v2/master/docs/source/gromet_FN_v{CURRENT_VERSION}.yaml
       ```
    3. Once it executes, the client code will be generated at your specified
       location.
       For python, the classes will be located in
       `$OUTPUT_PATH/swagger_client/models/`.
       For java, they will be located in
       `$OUTPUT_PATH/src/main/java/io/swagger/client/model/`

    If generating GroMEt schema data model classes in SKEMA (AutoMATES), then
    afer generating the above, follow the instructions here:
    ```
    <automates>/automates/model_assembly/gromet/model/README.md
    ```

        __Loop execution semantics__:
        The Boolean output Port of the condition Predicate represents the
        loop *exit condition*.
        Loop execution starts by first evaluating the loop condition.
        If the exit condition Port evaluates to True, then the current values
        at the input Ports to the Loop are copied to the output Ports and
        the execution moves past the Loop.
        Else, if the exit condition is False, then the values at the Outer
        Port Inputs are copied to the Loop body Input Ports, the body executes,
        and the resulting Output Ports of the body are copied to the Outer Port
        Inputs of the loop and execution advances to the next round of Loop
        evaluation.

            This is primarily for the support of for-loops, cases where most languages
            have provided an extension to loops that have an initialization that is
            only in the scope of the loop, but not part of the loop body.

        The Boolean output Port of the Conditional condition represents
        whether execution will proceed with the body_if (True) or the
        body_else (False). If there is no body_else and the condition is
        False, then the values at the Outer Port Input Ports are copied
        to the Outer Port Output Ports and execution moves past the
        Conditional.
